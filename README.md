As part of a collaboration with UTS, we aim to research, train, and build a machine learning model with the goal of predicting traders' profitability. 

## Project Stages

### 1: Literature Review

We conduct a literature review to identify potential factors influencing tradersâ€™ profit and loss (PNL) in finance trading, particularly in forex trading, and construct a conceptual model to describe them.

### 2: Data Processing and Analysis

Using forex transaction data provided by UTS, we explore the correlations between various factors and PNL. 

### 3: Model Creation and Testing

We build a data-driven prediction model to predict the profitability of traders by taking various factors as input. This model will offer brokers valuable insights into optimizing risk management strategies.
